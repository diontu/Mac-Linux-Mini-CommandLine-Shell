# Mac-Linux-Mini-CommandLine-Shell
Command Line Shell with a couple of commonly used commands

This project is a Shell interface with a couple of common commands implemented using the following C functions: ```fork()```, ```wait()```, and ```exec()```. The shell will prompt the user with ```mysh:~$``` and the user could enter a command as if they were using a Mac or Linux terminal.


This project highlights important features in Operating Systems such as **creating child processes**, **redirecting input/output**, and **executing processes in parallel** with respect to parent and child processes.
